## Abstract

Improving prompt quality is crucial for enhancing the performance of large language models (LLMs), particularly for Black-Box models like GPT4. Existing prompt refinement methods, while effective, often suffer from semantic inconsistencies between refined and original prompts, and fail to maintain users’ real intent. To address these challenges, we propose a self instructed in-context learning framework that generates reliable derived prompts, keeping semantic consistency with the original prompts. Specifically, our framework incorporates a reinforcement learning mechanism, enabling direct interaction with the response model during prompt generation to better align with human preferences. We then formulate the querying as an in-context learning task, combining responses from LLMs with derived prompts to create a contextual demonstration for the original prompt. This approach effectively enhances alignment, reduces semantic discrepancies, and activates the LLM’s in-context learning ability for generating more beneficial responses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method not only generates better derived prompts but also significantly enhances LLMs ability to deliver more effective responses, particularly for Black-Box models like GPT4.

## 1 Introduction

The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly advanced the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), achieving remarkable results across various tasks (OpenAI et al., 2023; Srivastava et al., 2022; Brown et al., 2020; Touvron et al., 2023; Devlin, 2018; Hu et al., 2023). The success of these models is highly dependent on the quality of the input prompts, as ambiguous or insecure prompts can lead to low-quality and unreliable responses (Zhou et al., 2022; Zamfirescu-Pereira et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023; Du et al., 2025b). Additionally, the high training costs associated with the large parameter sizes of these LLMs make it challenging to fine-tune for alignment when handling downstream tasks. In particular, for Black-Box LLMs, training is impossible. Therefore, utilizing better prompts to guide the models in generating the desired outputs has been an effective and promising approach in applying LLMs to various tasks.

To this end, several approaches are proposed to find the optimal prompts that can generally promote LLMs across various tasks. A popular approach is to refine the prompts with manually designed templates (Tam et al., 2021; Reynolds and McDonell, 2021), which, however, is limited in specific scenarios, resulting in a high manual workload and constrained usability (Webson and Pavlick, 2021). Therefore, some automated methods are proposed to rewrite prompts, which usually leverage the powerful capabilities of LLMs by directly asking the model to refine the prompts (Zhou et al., 2022; Fernando et al., 2023; Madaan et al., 2023), or by training a dedicated prompt refinement model to enhance prompt quality (Cheng et al., 2023; Deng et al., 2022; Kong et al., 2024; Zheng et al., 2024b). While effective, several challenges may limit their practical use on downstream tasks. For example, previous methods often require a labor-extensive data collection or complex template design, and the lack of interaction with the queried model (e.g., response model) that is used in downstream tasks during rewritten can result in prompts not fully compatible with it. Moreover, the prompt rewriting process may introduce several semantic inconsistencies between the refined and original prompts, potentially leading to less effective responses, as shown in Tab. 1. Given these considerations, we raise the following question:

Is there a more effective way to prompt the response model (e.g., Black-Box GPT4) than solely

## generating a refined prompt?

Building on the successes of in-context learning (ICL) in enhancing LLM performance through additional relevant demonstrations (Dong et al., 2022), we introduce a novel framework to stimulate LLMs into generating more helpful and reliable responses by automatically constructing an informative in-context environment for the original prompt. Specifically, we develop a derived prompt generation model that will be optimized through a selfinstructed reinforcement learning (RL) objective. By integrating the response model into the RL training process, our approach avoids extensive training data collection and ensures a closer alignment between the derived prompt and the response model. Crucially, instead of replacing the original prompt, we utilize the derived prompt-response pair as a semantically relevant ICL demonstration (Liu et al., 2021), thereby preserving the original prompt’s intent while leveraging the benefits of ICL and effectively stimulating the LLM’s inherent knowledge to produce higher-quality responses. Extensive experiments across various downstream datasets demonstrate significant improvements in response quality compared to existing prompt refinement methods, including enhancements in Black-Box models such as GPT4. Our approach presents a promising and interpretable paradigm for aligning LLMs without modifications, offering the following advantages:

• A novel framework for aligning LLMs with human preferences based on prompt improvement, applicable to Black-Box LLMs like GPT4.

• A data collection-free way for prompt refinement via a self-instructed RL objective.

• Automatic construction of informative ICL environments through high-quality demonstrations.

• Significant enhancements in response quality across various downstream datasets.

## 2 Background

SFT. Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with annotated text descriptions is widely used to adapt LLMs into downstream tasks. Given promptresponse pairs (x, y) sampled from a distribution $\mathcal { D } ,$ , SFT objective function is defined as:

$$
\mathcal { L } _ { \mathrm { S F T } } = - \mathbb { E } _ { ( x , y ) \sim \mathcal { D } } \left[ \sum _ { i } \log \pi _ { \mathrm { S F T } } ( y _ { i } | x , y _ { < i } ) \right] ,\tag{1}
$$

where π indicates a LLM policy and $y _ { < i }$ refers to all tokens before the i th token in response $y .$ In prompt rewritten task, x and y usually indicate original and refined prompt, respectively. For example, Cheng et al. (2023) and Zheng et al. (2024b) collect various (x, y) pairs generated from GPT4 and design a prompt refinement system by minimizing Eq. 1.

RLHF. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is another effective tuning method for improving the alignment of LLMs with human preferences, which typically involves two steps: reward modeling and RL training. In reward modeling, a reward model is designed to measure response quality to an input prompt: $\begin{array} { r l r } { { \mathcal L } _ { \mathrm { R e w a r d } } } & { { } = } & { - \mathbb { E } _ { ( x , y _ { c } , y _ { r } ) \sim { \mathcal D } } [ \log ( \sigma ( { \mathcal R } ( x , y _ { c } ) } & { - } \end{array}$ $\mathcal { R } ( x , y _ { r } ) ) ) ]$ , where $y _ { c }$ and $y _ { r }$ indicate good and bad response, respectively. $\sigma$ is the sigmoid function. Generally, RL training uses the PPO algorithm (Schulman et al., 2017) with an additional Kullback–Leibler (KL) regularization as below:

$$
\begin{array} { r } { \mathcal { L } _ { \mathrm { R L H F } } = \mathbb { E } _ { ( x \sim \mathcal { D } , y \sim \pi _ { \theta } ( y | x ) ) } \bigg [ \mathcal { R } ( x , y ) - \beta \log \frac { \pi _ { \theta } \left( y | x \right) } { \pi _ { \mathrm { S F T } } \left( y | x \right) } \bigg ] , } \end{array}\tag{2}
$$

where $\beta > 0$ is a hyper-parameter that controls the influence of the KL penalty. Training a prompt rewritten model using Eq. 2 is still impractical because it requires collecting a dataset of original prompts and refinements, for obtaining a basic rewriter π<sub>SFT</sub> and a specific reward model which can evaluate the quality of refined prompt.

Figure 1: (a) Previous methods directly replace the original prompt with the refined one, potentially risking semantic inconsistencies and ineffective responses. (b) Our method uses a derived prompt to create an incontext demonstration, ensuring high-quality responses while maintaining the integrity of the original prompt.

## 3 Motivation

As shown in Fig. 1(a), previous methods that directly replace the original prompt with a refined prompt to query LLMs often overlook valuable information contained in the original prompt, leading to ineffective responses due to essential semantic inconsistencies between the original and rewritten prompts. Fig. 1(b) gives a illustration to our method, which addresses this issue by generating a derived prompt that is used to query the response model. The derived prompt-response pair is then employed to construct a semantically similar, highquality demonstration for the original prompt. This in-context query process promotes the model’s ICL capabilities more effectively, ensuring more useful responses while consistently querying the original prompt, thereby avoiding ineffective results.

## 4 Methodology

## 4.1 Task Formulation

We begin with the definition of a derived prompt and its generation process. A derived prompt $x ^ { \prime }$ is a transformation of the original prompt x that maintains close relevance and shows improved expression, without necessarily being a rewritten or refined prompt. Our goal is to train an effective generation model π that is initialized by a LLM and can reliably produce a derived prompt $x ^ { \prime } \sim \pi ( x ^ { \prime } | x )$ given an original prompt x. Consequently, a higherquality response $y ^ { \prime }$ can be generated by query a response model , serving as more effective reply for x, due to their similar semantics. Generally, π can be a frozen Black-Box model (e.g., GPT4) or a learnable model. In this research, we focus on optimizing a trainable model π parameterized by $\boldsymbol { \theta } \in \mathbb { R } ^ { d }$ , with the goal of $x ^ { \prime }$ to be more semantically derived to x and better aligned with .

10 end

## 4.2 Self-instructed RL for Derived Prompt Generation Model

As mentioned in Sec. 2, directly using Eq. 1 and 2 to optimize a derived prompt generation model $\pi _ { \theta }$ typically introduces onerous data collection and lacks of alignment between derived prompts and response model, leading to suboptimal compatibility with downstream tasks. To address these issues, we propose a self-instructed RL objective for effective refinement model training.

Let $D = \{ x _ { i } \} _ { i = 1 } ^ { N }$ denote a training data set of length N, which only includes original prompts. Assume that we have a reliable reward model , which measures the response quality of the response model  when using the derived prompt $x ^ { \prime }$ . Instead of utilizing pre-collected $x ^ { \prime }$ to optimize the model $\pi _ { \theta }$ in an offline mode, we aim to leverage the reward for  response to $x ^ { \prime }$ to direct the optimization, which can further generate desirable $x ^ { \prime }$ that is better aligned with (We freeze during $\pi _ { \theta }$ <sup>training</sup> <sup>since</sup> <sup>the</sup> <sup>parameters</sup> <sup>of</sup> M <sup>may</sup> <sup>be</sup> inaccessible). To this end, we design to maximize the following objective:

$$
\begin{array} { r l } & { \mathbb { E } _ { \underset { x ^ { \prime } \sim \pi _ { \theta } ( x ^ { \prime } | x ) } { x \sim \mathcal { D } } } \bigg [ \mathcal { R } ( x ^ { \prime } , y ^ { \prime } ) - \beta \log \frac { \pi _ { \theta } ( x ^ { \prime } | x ) } { \pi _ { \mathrm { r e f } } ( x ^ { \prime } | x ) } \bigg ] , } \\ & { y ^ { \prime } { \sim } \mathcal { M } ( y ^ { \prime } | x ^ { \prime } ) } \end{array}\tag{3}
$$

where $x ^ { \prime } \sim \pi _ { \theta } ( x ^ { \prime } | x ) , y ^ { \prime } \sim \mathcal { M } ( y ^ { \prime } | x ^ { \prime } )$ and $\pi _ { \mathrm { r e f } }$ is the reference model identically initialized by π and $\beta$ is a hyper-parameter for stable model training.

It is important to note that Eq. 3 relies on the $\pi _ { \theta }$ model having a basic derived prompt generation capability. Given an original prompt x, π<sub>θ</sub> can directly rewrite it instead of performing the task in x (e.g., answering the question posed by x). Therefore, previous methods (Kong et al., 2024; Huang et al., 2024) necessitate an SFT stage to transform the pre-trained $\pi$ into a prompt rewriter π<sub>SFT</sub>, which initializes both $\pi _ { \theta }$ and $\pi _ { \mathrm { r e f } } .$ demanding extensive data collection of $( x , x ^ { \prime } )$ pairs.

Note that a well pre-trained LLM $\pi _ { \theta }$ should inherently possess basic capabilities of instructionfollowing (Ouyang et al., 2022) and paraphrasing. Therefore, we propose to use a derived prompt generation (DPG) instruction x<sub>DPG</sub> to overcome the necessity of SFT. Specifically, we manually design a x<sub>DPG</sub> as shown below:

```markdown
### Instruction: Please provide a more
comprehensive, easily understandable, and
answerable version ofthefollowing
question. Ensure that necessary contextual
information is added during the rewrite,
but do not limit the understanding and
response to the question. Avoid confining
the question to just a few aspects, allowing
the responder to thinkfrom multiple angles.
Only return the refined question and do not
explain. Here is my original question:".
### Question: {Original Prompt x}.
```

As expected, $\pi _ { \theta }$ should generate a reasonable derived prompt $x ^ { \prime }$ based its instruction-following capability:

$$
\begin{array} { r l } & { X = \mathbf { C o n c a t } ( [ x _ { \mathrm { D P G } } , x ] ) , } \\ & { x ^ { \prime } \sim \pi _ { \theta } ( X ) . } \end{array}\tag{4}
$$

With the help of x<sub>DPG</sub>, our method can effectively eliminate the need for data collection and additional training costs introduced by SFT. Additionally, by strategically leveraging the  into the training process of $\pi _ { \theta }$ , the generated derived prompts will be more in line with the preferences of the response model. Our final training objective is shown below:

$$
\begin{array} { r l } & { \mathbb { E } _ { \underset { x ^ { \prime } \sim \pi _ { \theta } ( x ^ { \prime } | x ) } { x \sim \mathcal { N } } } \left[ \mathcal { R } ( x ^ { \prime } , y ^ { \prime } ) - \beta \log \frac { \pi _ { \theta } ( x ^ { \prime } | x ) } { \pi _ { \mathrm { r e f } } ( x ^ { \prime } | x ) } \right] . } \\ & { y ^ { \prime } { \sim } \mathcal { M } ( y ^ { \prime } | x ^ { \prime } ) } \end{array}\tag{5}
$$

We summarize the training process in $\mathrm { A l g . 1 }$

5 Query LLM and obtain final response;

## 4.3 Intent-Consistency Oriented In-context Query Framework for Inference

Although the derived prompt generation model optimized by Eq. 5 can produce higher-quality, semantically rich, and more compatible $x ^ { \prime }$ with the response model , there still remains a risk of semantic inconsistency and intent shift due to the uncontrollability of the generation process. Consequently, directly replacing the original prompt with the derived prompt would not be the optimal solution to make full use of it, even for our method.

To address the mentioned issue and better activate the LLM’s inherent knowledge, we propose a general in-context query framework to mitigate potential semantic discrepancy, where we leverage high-quality, relevant in-context demonstrations derived from the original prompt. Therefore, this approaches can effectively enhance LLM ability to better respond to the user’s original query. As shown in Alg. 2, we construct an intent-consistent in-context query by filling the following template using $( x , x ^ { \prime } , y ^ { \prime } )$ , where $x , x ^ { \prime } , y ^ { \prime }$ indicates the original prompt, its corresponding derived prompt and the LLM response to the derived prompt, respectively. This in-context query requires the better LLM respond to the original question x by emulating the quality, style, and level of detail of the response $y ^ { \prime }$ given to $x ^ { \prime } { \mathrm { i } }$

```markdown
### Question: {Derived Prompt x′}.
### Response: {Response y′}.
Given the above Question and Response as an
example, emulate the way it responds to the question
to reply to the following question:
### Question: {Original Prompt x}.
```

This in-context query framework ensures that the final response aligns more closely with the original intent included in $x ,$ while maintaining the enhanced response characteristics corresponding to the derived prompt. Therefore, it mitigates potential discrepancies between the refined prompt and the original prompt, leading to responses that are more helpful, reliable, and consistent with user expectations.

## 5 Experiments

In this section, we conduct extensive experiments on various downstream datasets to comprehensively evaluate our method when compared with baseline methods. Ablation studies demonstrate the superior and necessity of our proposed selfinstructed RL method for derived prompt generation, and also shows that ICL can serve as a flexible play-and-plug module to generally boosting existing methods to achieve better performance. We also conduct human evaluations and efficiency analysis. Detailed training settings are in Appendix B and we conduct experiment for two runs.

## 5.1 Experimental Setup

Datasets. To train a derived prompt generation model by Eq. 5, we utilize the BPO training dataset by following previous work (Huang et al., 2024; Cheng et al., 2023), which is constructed from four meticulously selected datasets and comprises 14K diverse samples. In order to comprehensively evaluate the performance of our method, we adopt wide-used instruction datasets for assessment, including Dolly Eval (Conover et al., 2023), Vicuna Eval (Chiang et al., 2023), Self-Instruct Eval (Wang et al., 2022) and BPO test Eval (Cheng et al., 2023). We provide detailed description in Appendix B.

Derived Prompt Generation Model. We particularly focus training an effective π<sub>θ</sub> based on the popular LLMs such as LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023) and Qwen (Yang et al., 2024a). Specifically, considering that our method relies on an instructionfollowing capability for derived prompt generation, we apply our method to Llama2-chat (Touvron et al., 2023), Llama3-8B-Instruct (Touvron et al., 2023) and Qwen2-7B-Instruct (Yang et al., 2024a), which are all abbreviated as Llama3, Llama2 and Qwen2, respectively.

Reward Model . Recall that we employ a RL objective to optimize $\pi _ { \theta }$ by maximizing Eq. 5. To effectively evaluate the quality of generated pairs $( x ^ { \prime } , y ^ { \prime } )$ , we employ a popular and SOTA reward model<sup>1</sup> trained on hh-rlhf helpful dataset (Bai et al., 2022a) and proven effective in various works by matching other larger reward models.

Queried Model . A queried model is an frozen model used to generate responses to various prompt inputs and in the training process of the derived prompt generation model, we require an that generates a response $y ^ { \prime }$ to the derived prompt $x ^ { \prime }$ to maximize Eq. 5. Here, we experimentally employ both Black-box LLMs like GPT3.5- turbo (GPT3.5) and GPT4o (GPT4), and white-box LLMs like Llama2-7B-chat (Llama2-7B), Llama3- 8B-Instruct (Llama3-8B) and Qwen2-7B-Instruct (Qwen2-7B).

Baselines and Evaluation Metrics. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in helping LLMs generate more effective responses within the scope of being adaptable to Black-box LLMs, we conduct a comprehensive comparison with existing SOTA prompt refinement methods: BPO (Cheng et al., 2023), PAS (Zheng et al., 2024b), and Self-Refine (Madaan et al., 2023). We provide a detailed introduction to baselines in App. B.2. Following common practices of serving LLM as a judge (Zheng et al., 2024a; Wang et al., 2023), we utilize GPT4 for assessment, using prompts from the MT-bench (Zheng et al., 2024a). To ensure fairness and mitigate position bias, we implement random shuffling in each evaluation round. We also report Win Rate (WR), which is computed by (A Win  B Win)%.

## 5.2 Main Results

We use the name of method to denote the responses obtained by the LLM from the correspond method. For example, OP indicates that of Original Prompt, where BPO, PA, SR and OD indicates that of BPO, PAS, Self-Refine and Our Derived prompt, respectively. ICL represents the ICL formulation. OURS indicates OD + ICL. As shown in Tab. 2, our method shows an overall performance improvement than baseline methods across various settings, highlighting the following advantages:

Generalizability Across Datasets: Our method demonstrates excellent performance across all four evaluation datasets compared to baselines. The ICL queries generated by our method effectively promote the LLM to produce higher-quality and more comprehensive responses to the original questions, showcasing its robustness in handling various tasks, whether complex or simple.

Consistency Across Models: Our method shows consistent performance improvement between different families of models. For example, based on the Llama2 model as π<sub>θ</sub>, the average WRs of our method on Llama3, Llama2 and Qwen2 for BPO are 39.63%, 48.3% and 64.3%, while those for more powerful method PAS are 32.8%, 47.9% and 44.7% respectively. These consistent higher results demonstrate that our method maintains high performance and robustness across a variety of underlying models, ensuring reliable results independent to models.

Cross-Model Transferability: Tab. 2 also shows that the π trained on Llama3 and constructed ICL queries can achieve better response quality on other models (e.g., Llama2 and Qwen2). For example, the model trained on Llama2 based on Dolley Eval has a WR of 26.5% on Llama3 and 74.0% on Qwen2 compared with OD, and that are 12.5% and 58.0% compared with BPO. This suggests that our method has good cross-model transferability and can maintain high performance across different models.

Improved Black-Box Model Performance: Our method significantly improved the response quality of GPT4 and GPT3.5. For instance, when training on Llama3, the average WRs of OURS on GPT4 compared with OP and BPO are 67.1% and 56.1%, respectively. And thoese on GPT3.5 are 74.3% and 69.9%, respectively. The significant improvement indicates that our method effectively promote Black-Box LLM generate high-quality response. Similarly, in other datasets, the WRs of our method on GPT series models are also significantly higher than those of SOTA methods.

## 5.3 Ablation Study

To further illustrate the advantages of our proposed self-instructed RL (OD) and the importance of the ICL environment (ICL), we use our derived prompts generated by Llama3-8B to query GPT4, where the generated response are then evaluated by GPT4. We compare various combinations of OD and ICL with other methods on two evaluation datasets: Vicuna Eval and Self-Instruct.

Table 3: Analysis on our self-instruct RL objective.
<table><tr><td rowspan="2">Method A</td><td rowspan="2">B</td><td colspan="3">Vicuna Eval</td><td colspan="3">Self-Instruct</td></tr><tr><td>A Win</td><td>1 B Win</td><td>Tie</td><td>A Win B Win</td><td></td><td>Tie</td></tr><tr><td>OD</td><td>OP</td><td>78.8</td><td>11.2</td><td>10.0</td><td>66.3</td><td>15.5</td><td>18.2</td></tr><tr><td>OD</td><td>BPO</td><td>72.5</td><td>21.3</td><td>6.2</td><td>42.1</td><td>8.7</td><td>49.2</td></tr><tr><td>OD</td><td>PAS</td><td>57.2</td><td>27.4</td><td>15.4</td><td>45.1</td><td>27.2</td><td>27.7</td></tr></table>

Is our RL objective effective in performance improvement? Tab. 3 demonstrates that, from the perspective of prompt refinement, our OD already exhibits higher quality than BPO and PAS, thereby promoting LLMs to generate more helpful responses. When compared with BPO, the WR of OD is 51.2% in Vicuna Eval and 33.4% in Self-Instruct, which is 29.8% and 17.9% on PAS. These results consistently suggest that even without ICL, our OD has already been more effective in better promote LLMs and thus obtaining more helpful responses, emphasizing the robustness and effectiveness of our proposed RL objective.

Can our proposed ICL formulation boost other methods? Tab. 4 shows that our proposed automatic construction of ICL can significantly boost BPO and PAS by achieving an increased WRs in Vicuna Eval and Self-Instruct, compared with OP or themselves. For example, when equipped with ICL, BPO obtains 7.15% average WR gain than OP. And BPO + ICL achieves 59.0% WR compared with BPO, demonstrating our proposed ICL query formulation is a general framework suitable with various prompt refinement methods.

Equally equipped ICL, can our method fairly outperform SOTA methods? Finally, Tab. 5 supports that even all equipped with ICL, our method still outperforms BPO and PAS with average WRs of 63.9% and 33.9% in Vicuna Eval, 47.5% and 29.2% in Self-Instruct, suggesting that the OD + ICL combination consistently provides stable and superior performance improvements across different environments.

In summary, our derived prompts enhanced by self-instructed RL are more effective than BPO and PAS prompts, in promoting LLMs to produce high-quality responses. Additionally, our proposed ICL querying formulation is a flexible, effective, and general framework that can enhance various prompt refinement methods in obtaining better responses to the original queries.

## 5.4 Necessity and Efficiency Analysis

In this section, we mainly focus on independently analyzing how our proposed self-instructed RL and ICL query framework perform. Fig. 2 shows: 1) Necessity of ICL framework: Without training, directly using LLM to generate derived prompts combined with ICL (OD + ICL) has already achieved excellent results, achieves 39.1% WRs improvement. This supervising performance indicates that our proposed ICL framework is highly general and effective even without additional optimization, showing a potential in low computation consuming. 2) Effectiveness of selfinstructed RL: After optimization with RL, our method achieves a higher WRs increasing from 17.6% to 67.6% on OD vs OP, and that from 39.1% to 86.2% on OD + ICL vs OP, which is also better than using SFT. This highlights the significant advantage of our proposed RL in generating higher

quality derived prompts.

In addition to the performance, we also conduct an efficiency analysis from the perspective of both training and inference. As shown in Tab. 6, although our method requires additional query of LLM for automatically generating ICL demonstrations and longer generation time in inference, our method eliminates the requirement of data collection in training process, which, however, serves as the foundation of both BPO and PAS. Overall, regarding the significant performance improvement, our method could show an acceptable trade-off between efficiency and performance.

## 5.5 Case Study and Human Evaluation

As shown in Fig. 3, BPO significantly alters the original prompt’s intent, restricting the response to the relationship between green tea and cancer while neglecting other benefits. In contrast, our derived prompt maintains consistency with the original prompt’s content and expands upon it. Consequently, the comparison between the original response and the ICL response reveals that our approach not only effectively covers the information present in the original response, but also stimulates the LLM’s intrinsic knowledge, resulting in more comprehensive and detailed descriptions. We provide human evaluation in Appendix B.5.

## 6 Related Work

Prompt Refinement. Prompts are crucial for guiding LLMs to produce better response, leading to extensive research on improving their quality. Initially, prompt optimization relied on manually crafted templates (Reynolds and McDonell, 2021), a labor-intensive process with interpretation challenges (Webson and Pavlick, 2021). Recent studies automate this process using techniques like gradient-based search (Shin et al., 2020; Pryzant et al., 2023), paraphrasing (Haviv et al., 2021; Jiang et al., 2020) and leveraging LLMs to generate prompts (Zhou et al., 2022; Fernando et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2024b; Cheng et al., 2023). Additionally, RL based methods are designed to optimize a prompt rewritten model through reward functions and task-specific templates (Deng et al., 2022; Kong et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2022; Huang et al., 2024).

RLHF. RLHF has been widely explored to align LLMs with human preferences (Stiennon et al., 2020; Ouyang et al., 2022; Bai et al., 2022b; Lee et al., 2023). Common approaches include building a reward model using maximize likelihood estimation (MLE) and optimizing it with the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm (Schulman et al., 2017). However, replicating PPO’s success has proven challenging for the open-source community due to the high resource demands. To address this, some research has shifted to offline direct preference learning (Zhao et al., 2023; Rafailov et al.,

2024; Li et al., 2023), which bypasses reward modeling and directly optimizes a loss target using an offline dataset. On the other hand, Du et al. (2025a) designs to align LLM with the optimal solution of RLHF by minimizing their KL divergence in an offline manner.

Improving In-Context Learning. Several approaches have been introduced to enhance incontext learning (ICL) performance by improving the selection of in-context examples. Some methods focus on refining template selection (Yin et al., 2023), while others aim to enhance the choice of examples (Liu et al., 2021; Rubin et al., 2021). Additionally, Wan et al. (2023) introduces a criterion for evaluating examples based on some criteria. Other recent innovations include flipped learning (Ye et al., 2022) and noisy channel prompting (Min et al., 2021). Hu et al. (2022) designs to extract graphs from input text to facilitate the understanding and summarization of the current input and Li et al. (2025) can also be used to select in-context examples of high-quality automatically.

## 7 Conclusion

This paper introduced an innovative method for enhancing LLM performance using an automatically generated in-context learning framework. By creating derived prompts through a self-instruct RL mechanism, our approach enriches the context of the original prompts. Extensive experiments reveal that our framework significantly improves response quality, even for Black-Box models like GPT4. Excellent performance suggests that our method offers a promising paradigm for aligning LLMs without modifications, improving their usability and effectiveness in various applications.

## 9 Limitations and Ethical Statement

In this research, we propose a novel approach that utilizes a self-instructed RL objective for prompt refinement. To better leverage the information within user prompts, we introduce the automatic Construction of ICL to preserve user intent. Although our method achieves better results compared to the SOTA methods and eliminates the requirement of data collection, it employs RL for model training, incurring a certain computational cost. Moreover, our method depends on additional queries to the LLM during the construction of ICL demonstrations. In our experiments, we analyze and find that our method can be integrated as a plug-and-play framework with existing methods to enhance them. Additionally, our current exploration is now limited to the one-shot demonstration setting. In addition, we applied our method in the domains of mathematics and programming. However, we found that it is challenging for the model to automatically generate high-quality examples that are semantically similar to the current input question, indicating that our current method is not yet directly adaptable to tasks in math and coding.

In the future, we will investigate better and more effective n-shots settings to further improve performance. Moreover, we will also explore the approach of sharing demonstrations to increase efficiency and reduce the cost of generating examples, and explore how to adapt to math and reasoning tasks. During the design of our method, we have carefully considered the potential generation of harmful and unethical content. We are committed to actively contributing to the community and society and avoiding any negative impacts caused by AI technology.

## B Experiments

## B.1 Datasets

By following Cheng et al. (2023), we also adopt the BPO dataset for our model training, which is designed for optimized prompts and has its origin in four instruction-tuning datasets that are annotated with human preferences. The collection process involves gathering these datasets and then reformulating them. Lowquality instances are identified and eliminated based on manually devised rules, such as discarding overly short instructions. Additionally, a strict diversity filtering is carried out using self-bleu. Through this comprehensive process, a total of 14k diverse samples are obtained. This dataset mainly concentrates on single-turn response generation.

To attain a more accurate and refined evaluation of the alignment quality, we deliberately chose to employ a multiplicity of instruction datasets for the assessment endeavor. They are:

• The Dolly Eval constitutes a subset that consists of 200 instances randomly sampled from the dolly dataset (Conover et al., 2023). This dataset, which is crafted by human efforts, embraces eight discrete categories of tasks.

• The Vicuna Eval (Chiang et al., 2023) encompasses 80 variegated questions distributed among 8 distinct classifications.

• The Self-Instruct Eval is a human evaluation dataset devised by Wang et al. (2022). It incorporates 252 user-centered instructions that were meticulously composed by experts and spurred by real-world application scenarios.

• The BPO-test Eval (Cheng et al., 2023) represents a partition of BPO dataset, enclosing 200 samples extracted from the four datasets that were utilized during the assemblage of the training set.

## B.2 Introduction to Baseline Methods

To provide a clearer understanding of the baseline methodologies used in our paper, we offer a brief explanation of each approach, highlighting their definitions, characteristics, and limitations, as well as the targeted advantages of our method.

Original Prompt (OP): The original prompt is the initial query or instruction provided by the user to the LLM without any modifications or enhancements. It is straightforward and relies solely on the LLM’s ability to understand and respond to the query as given. However, OP often lacks the specificity or context needed for the LLM to generate high-quality, relevant responses, especially for complex queries. As a result, several prompt refinement methods are proposed to improve the quality of the input prompt, thus obtaining a better response.

Black-Box Prompt Optimization (BPO): BPO (Cheng et al., 2023) is designed to optimize user prompts to better align with the LLM’s input understanding, by learning to optimize a refinement model. BPO requires collecting large amounts of original prompt, refined prompt pairs distilled from ChatGPT, which is resource-intensive based on a human-collected dataset. Besides, BPO relies solely on SFT for training the prompt refinement model, which is less effective compared to RL and can not significantly reduce the overall cost due to the requirement of collecting data. Moreover, BPO directly replaces the original prompt with the refined prompt, which can lead to changes in user intent and result in unusable responses, as shown in Table 1 of our paper.

Self-Refine: Self-Refine (Madaan et al., 2023) is an iterative refinement method that uses the LLM’s own feedback to improve the quality of its responses, which allows the model to iteratively correct and refine its responses, leading to significant improvements in tasks requiring multiple attempts to achieve the desired output. However, the effectiveness of Self-Refine can vary depending on the task and the initial quality of the LLM’s responses, which lacks of the additional necessary supervision and thus may not be as enough effective as possible.

Plug-and-Play Prompt Augmentation System (PAS): PAS(Zheng et al., 2024b) is a plug-and-play system that enhances prompts using high-quality, automatically generated complementary datasets. While PAS shows significant improvements over baseline models like OP and BPO, it still requires the humanintensive data collection. Moreover, PAS relies on a systematic framework to improve the prompt by strategically incorporating prompt data selection and complementary dataset generation. As a result, PAS achieves better performance than BPO with the help of several complex and onerous modules. On the other hand, PAS also suffers from the same issue with BPO, which they can not keep the user original intent perfectly.

## B.3 Training Settings.

For training settings, we use ReMax (Li et al., 2023) to train the derived prompt generation model facilitated by DeepSpeed ZeRO-2 (DeepSpeed, 2024). We set the temperature parameter to $\tau = 0 . 0$ and use nucleus sampling with a parameter of $\mathrm { t o p } _ { p } = 0 . 9$ for all models. The maximum length for derived prompt generation and response model is set to 1024 tokens. We conduct experiments on 4 NVIDIA A100 GPUs. All experiments are trained with a learning rate of $1 \times 1 0 ^ { - 6 }$ for 2 epoch with decay, where the KL penalty $\beta$ is set to 0.05 for all models. Our batch size is set to 1.

## B.4 Evaluation on Reward Model

In addition to GPT4 as an evaluator for comparing the quality of response promoted by different methods, we also adopt Reward Score into quantitative evaluation, which provides a more comprehensive understanding of our method. Therefore, we train a Llama3-8B-Instruct LLM as a derived prompt generation model and then query GPT4. As shown in Tab. 8, we can observe our method can promote GPT4 to generate more useful and higher quality responses in the view of Reward Score, except for Dolley Eval.

## B.5 Human Evaluation

In this section, we conduct a human evaluation regarding two crucial questions: Q1) Is semantic inconsistency between the refined and original prompts prevalent? Q2) Do the responses generated by our method align more closely with human preference? We engaged four human experts to conduct this evaluation based on BPO-test Eval.

Table 8: Comparison of different Black-Box optimization methods across Vicuna Eval and Self-Instruct based on querying GPT4.

For Q1, we primarily considered: 1) whether the refined prompt maintained the intent of the original prompt; 2) whether the refined prompt predefined the angle of AI assistance’s response; 3) if the refined prompt introduced any unintended biases or assumptions.

Table 9: Performance of BPO, PAS, and Our Method on Q1 Evaluation Metrics
<table><tr><td>Metric</td><td>BPO</td><td>PAS</td><td>Our Method</td></tr><tr><td>Maintain Original Intent</td><td>75.2%</td><td>82.5%</td><td>86.3%</td></tr><tr><td>Predefined Response Angle</td><td>23.7%</td><td>22.1%</td><td>16.4%</td></tr><tr><td>Introduced Bias or Assumption</td><td>24.6%</td><td>25.8%</td><td>17.9%</td></tr></table>

The results in Tab. 9 indicate that Our Method consistently outperforms both BPO and PAS across all metrics. In terms of maintaining the original intent, Our Method achieves an 86.3% success rate, surpassing PAS at 82.5% and BPO at 75.2%. This demonstrates its superior capability to preserve the original meaning of prompts. Additionally, Our Method shows a significant advantage in minimizing predefined response angles, with only 16.4% compared to BPO’s 23.7% and PAS’s 22.1%. This suggests that Our Method is less constrained by rigid response frameworks.

Moreover, Our Method excels in reducing introduced bias or assumptions, achieving the lowest percentage at 17.9%. In contrast, BPO and PAS have higher rates of bias introduction, at 24.6% and 25.8%, respectively. These findings highlight Our Method’s effectiveness in generating responses that align more closely with human preferences, offering greater accuracy and neutrality. Overall, these results suggest that Our Method is a more reliable approach for producing high-quality, unbiased responses, with potential for further refinement and application in diverse contexts.

Additionally, for Q2, we assessed whether the responses generated by our method were more coherent, relevant, and satisfactory compared to original prompt, BPO, PAS and Self-Refine. The experts reviewed 50 prompt-response pairs to ensure a comprehensive evaluation. Their insights were invaluable in determining the effectiveness of our approach in aligning AI outputs with human expectations.

The average scores in Tab. 10 indicate that out method consistently achieves the highest ratings across coherence, relevance, and satisfaction, outperforming all other methods. The progression from Original Prompt, through Self-Refine and BPO, to PAS, and finally to Our Method, illustrates a clear improvement in aligning AI-generated responses with human expectations. This demonstrates the effectiveness of Our Method in producing superior quality outputs across all evaluated metrics.

Table 10: Average Scores by Human Experts on Coherence, Relevance, and Satisfaction
<table><tr><td>Metric</td><td>OP</td><td>Self-Refine</td><td>BPO</td><td>PAS</td><td>OURS</td></tr><tr><td>Coherence</td><td>2.1</td><td>2.5</td><td>2.8</td><td>3.2</td><td>3.8</td></tr><tr><td>Relevance</td><td>2.3</td><td>2.7</td><td>2.4</td><td>3.1</td><td>3.9</td></tr><tr><td>Satisfaction</td><td>2.0</td><td>2.2</td><td>2.6</td><td>3.3</td><td>4.0</td></tr></table>
